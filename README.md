# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions, in Rust of course. I'm doing these for fun, not for leaderboard points, so my
solutions might be posted late or not at all.

Starting on day 2, I tried to commit before doing `cargo test` or `cargo run`, and then not
squashing any commits, so that you can see all my mistakes!
